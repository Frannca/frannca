                <p>In activity since 2015, the company story started to be written a couple years before. When the
                    founder got the first clients. Always seeking to improve your skills, the first projects were
                    simple, but with focus in the clients needs. Before the foundation, Webhost demonstrated interest in
                    forming a partnership for the development of projects. The partnership showed a promising future,
                    and in the same year the Frannca company was founded.</p>

                    its customers, in 2017 the company started working with <b>Angular</b> and <b>API</b>. The
                    improvements also extended to usability, using <b>Semantic UI</b> instead of <b>Bootstrap</b>.
                    Always seeking to bring innovative solutions.</p>
